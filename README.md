ongoal makes 35572 data points available for Pittsburgh Penguins games
where the it was determined whether a shot was on goal (i.e., made it to
the goaltender) or not (i.e., missed or blocked). Data are from seasons
2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018.

Several other columns were recorded related to the game, player, and
shot. The data are not perfect; the determination of power play duration
were manually calculated and may not be completely accurate.
